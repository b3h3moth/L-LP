## Attributes of Variables

The keyword `__attribute__` allows you to specify special attributes of variables 
or structure fields. This keyword is followed by an attribute specification inside 
double parentheses. Some attributes are currently defined generically for variables. 
Other attributes are defined for variables on particular target systems.
