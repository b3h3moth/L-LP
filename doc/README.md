# UnixCentric Documentation 

The documentation is splitted into many sections, each of which is a single page, 
in such a way as to make the usability as fast as possible.

UnixCentric covers everything inherent the UNIX Universe, however, as well as 
for the code, there are two main areas: the C language and Unix Systems 
Programming.
